      <h2>What is Streaming Media?</h2>

      <p>Streaming Media refers to any multimedia, i.e, movies, TV, music or podcasts that we can access and play over a
        network, like the internet.The main feature of stream media is, users can have access to the content without
        needing to download or store it in the hard drive files. This way, they can have access to as many contents
        without having to add extra storage in their devices. Examples of Streaming Media includes YouTube, Netflix,
        Television broadcasts and corporate webcasts.

      <h3>Advancement of Streaming Services</h3>
      <p>Streaming Media was still a concept in the early 80's when users had restricted to less access to internet and
        computers. Even tough consumer grade personal computers were became powerful enough to display various media,
        technical issue such as not having enough CUP and bus bandwith to support required data rates were still not met
        in the 90's. But in the early 2000s when users had increased access to bandwith, streaming media started
        fascilitating.

        <dt>Bus Bandwith</dt>
        <dd>Bus width refers to the number of bits that can be sent to the CPU simultaneouslyFor example, ISA supports
          8-and 16-bit widths, EISA and MCA support 16and 32-bit widths, and PCI supports 32-and 64-bit widths</dd>

      <h3>The Market and Its Competition</h3>
      <p>Streaming Media has coined a new era of compettion among video and audio streaming services.Top streaming media
        services in today's world include names like;
      <ol type="i">
        <li>Amazon Prime Video</li>
        <li>Netflix</li>
        <li>Disney+</li>
        <li>HBO Max</li>
        <li>Apple TV</li>
        <li>Spotify</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Competition among online platforms has forced them to find ways to differentiate themselves. One key way they
        have done this is by offering exclusive content, often self-produced and created specifically for a market. This
        approach to streaming competition, can have disadvantages for consumers and for the industry as a whole. Once
        content is made available online, the corresponding piracy searches decrease. Competition or legal availability
        across multiple platforms effectively deters online piracy and more exclusivity does not necessarily translate
        into higher average investment in content, as investment decisions are also dependent on the level and type of
        competition in online markets.</p>

      <p>Here's a table portraying the number of subscribers of a few large paid media streaming services in 2022:</p>

      <h3>Future Prospective of Streaming Media</h3>
      <p>As per our analysis, Streaming Media services in the future is likely to grow. Considering how high bandwitdth
        is required for a seamless stream, currently streaming servicees like Apple TV+, Netflix is not as much
        introduced in dveloping nations where internet is still an isuue. In the future as it is expected, availability
        of highspeed data would grow and hence more people would be investing in media streaming because of its global
        outreach</p>
      <p> But there are few aspects which still need to be considered. Even though the current subscriptions for the
        paid streaming media services such as, Netflix reaches mles, it might not be so similar in near future. Modern
        day economical barriers like inflammation would hinder the number of subcriptions in near future as more people
        are likely to not afford paying for the subscription service anymore. "PAID" streaming media agencies and brands
        should consider the folllowing aspects soon enough to come up with a solution:
      <ol>
        <li> Free streamingâ€™s audience will grow larger than paid streaming by mid-2022</li>
        <li>Free streaming viewership is expanding rapidly among educated and higher-income earners</li>
        <li>Free streaming platforms are garnering distinct, loyal audiences, while maintaining audience overlap with
          SVOD</li>
        <li>Streaming will become the fastest growing video format in both viewership and media investment</li>
        <li>Streaming viewers are becoming more receptive to ads</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Overall, more cross-industry and cross-practice research is needed to get a better understanding of streaming
        as a phenomenon and how it evolves. In this article, we have tried to explain what stream media is, it's
        purpose, features, development, corporate section of streaming services, it's future perspective . We maintain
        that such a broad and open-ended approach to streaming is more useful at present, rather than attempting to
        provide a limited definition of the phenomenon. Borders and distinctions are under negotiation and in flux:
        between legal and illegal, between live and on-demand, between user-generated and professional content, between
        national and global. For example, the differences between a basically professional content platform like
        Netflix, a basically UGC platform like YouTube and a basically social media platform like Facebook (offering
        Facebook Watch) is clearly not fixed and stabilized, neither economically nor culturally. Therefore, an
        exclusion of any of these from a definition of streaming is at best premature.</p>
