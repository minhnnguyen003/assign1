                <h1>What is Streaming Media?</h1>

                <p>Streaming Media refers to any multimedia, i.e, movies, TV, music or podcasts that we can access and
                    play
                    over a network, like the internet.The main feature of stream media is, users can have access to the
                    content without needing to download or store it in the hard drive files. This way, they can have
                    access
                    to as many contents without having to add extra storage in their devices. Examples of Streaming
                    Media
                    includes YouTube, Netflix, Television broadcasts and corporate webcasts.

                <h1>Advancement of Streaming Services</h1>
                <p>Streaming Media was still a concept in the early 80's when users had restricted to less access to
                    internet and computers. Even tough consumer grade personal computers were became powerful enough to
                    display various media, technical issue such as not having enough CUP and bus bandwith to support
                    required data rates were still not met in the 90's. But in the early 2000s when users had increased
                    access to bandwith, streaming media started fascilitating.


                <aside>Bus Bandwith: Bus width refers to the number of bits that can be sent to the CPU
                    simultaneouslyFor
                    example, ISA supports 8-and 16-bit widths, EISA and MCA support 16and 32-bit widths, and PCI
                    supports
                    32-and 64-bit widths</aside>

            <section>
                <h1>The Market and Its Competition</h1>
                <p>Streaming Media has coined a new era of compettion among video and audio streaming services.Top
                    streaming
                    media services in today's world include names like;
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Amazon Prime Video</li>
                    <li>Netflix</li>
                    <li>Disney+</li>
                    <li>HBO Max</li>
                    <li>Apple TV</li>
                    <li>Spotify</li>
                </ol>
                </p>


                <p>Competition among online platforms has forced them to find ways to differentiate themselves. One key
                    way
                    they have done this is by offering exclusive content, often self-produced and created specifically
                    for a
                    market. This approach to streaming competition, can have disadvantages for consumers and for the
                    industry as a whole. Once content is made available online, the corresponding piracy searches
                    decrease.
                    Competition or legal availability across multiple platforms effectively deters online piracy and
                    more
                    exclusivity does not necessarily translate into higher average investment in content, as investment
                    decisions are also dependent on the level and type of competition in online markets.</p>

                    2022:

                <h1>Advantages and Disadvantages of Streaming Media</h1>

                <p>In Today's world streaming media is dominantly replacing Television and universal broadcasting. Few
                    distinct features of streaming media like, how useres are able to enjoy a movie seamlessly without
                    having to watch those annoying ads, having access to watch any movie of choice at anytime made its
                    popularity universal. Other key advantages of streaming media could include: </p>

                <p>
                <ul>

                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>Even though the current popularity of streaming media is inclining, few of its disadvantages are
                    still
                    dragging it down to some extent. Since streaming media is paid, it's key disadvantage is a large
                    number
                    of unprivileged poeple can't access it. Exisiting users are also falling out because of its soaring

                <h1>Future Prospective of Streaming Media</h1>
                <p>As per our analysis, Streaming Media services in the future is likely to grow. Considering how high
                    bandwitdth is required for a seamless stream, currently streaming servicees like Apple TV+, Netflix
                    is
                    not as much introduced in dveloping nations where internet is still an isuue. In the future as it is
                    expected, availability of highspeed data would grow and hence more people would be investing in
                    media
                    streaming because of its global outreach</p>
                <p> But there are few aspects which still need to be considered. Even though the current subscriptions
                    for
                    the paid streaming media services such as, Netflix reaches mles, it might not be so similar in near
                    future. Modern day economical barriers like inflammation would hinder the number of subcriptions in
                    near
                    future as more people are likely to not afford paying for the subscription service anymore. "PAID"
                    streaming media agencies and brands should consider the folllowing aspects soon enough to come up
                    with a
                    solution:
                <ol>
                    <li> Free streaming’s audience will grow larger than paid streaming by mid-2022</li>
                    <li>Free streaming viewership is expanding rapidly among educated and higher-income earners</li>
                    <li>Free streaming platforms are garnering distinct, loyal audiences, while maintaining audience
                        overlap
                        with SVOD</li>
                    <li>Streaming will become the fastest growing video format in both viewership and media investment
                    </li>
                    <li>Streaming viewers are becoming more receptive to ads</li>
                </ol>

                <br><br><br>
                <p>Overall, more cross-industry and cross-practice research is needed to get a better understanding of
                    streaming as a phenomenon and how it evolves. In this article, we have tried to explain what stream
                    media is, it's purpose, features, development, corporate section of streaming services, it's future
                    perspective . We maintain that such a broad and open-ended approach to streaming is more useful at
                    present, rather than attempting to provide a limited definition of the phenomenon. Borders and
                    distinctions are under negotiation and in flux: between legal and illegal, between live and
                    on-demand,
                    between user-generated and professional content, between national and global. For example, the
                    differences between a basically professional content platform like Netflix, a basically UGC platform
                    like YouTube and a basically social media platform like Facebook (offering Facebook Watch) is
                    clearly
                    not fixed and stabilized, neither economically nor culturally. Therefore, an exclusion of any of
                    these
                    from a definition of streaming is at best premature.</p>
